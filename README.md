- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, my name is Jeff! I am new to programming!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning anything I can add to my repertoire. I want to be able to learn how to use a programming language as tools for software as a
     screwdriver is used for hardware.
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning LaTeX. My next programming languages to be learned will be sed and awk.
